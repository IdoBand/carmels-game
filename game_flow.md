# Toddler Counting Game - Current Game Flow Implementation

## ✅ TECHNICAL SETUP PHASE (IMPLEMENTED)
- User navigates to localhost:5000
- User clicks "Find My Camera" button
- Backend searches for available cameras, presents list to frontend
- User selects a camera from the list
- User clicks "Start" button
- Camera starts with Full HD resolution (1920x1080 → 1280x720 → 640x480 fallback)
- Real-time video feed displays with MediaPipe hand landmarks (green dots + white lines)
- **STATUS**: ✅ FULLY WORKING

## ✅ USER SETUP PHASE (IMPLEMENTED)
- Live video displays in full-screen mode (90% viewport)
- **4 seconds after camera starts**: Play "hi_ready_to_play.mp3" ✅
- **After greeting finishes**: Wait 2 seconds → play "show_me_your_fingers.mp3" ✅
- **Hand detection**: Wait for ANY MediaPipe hand detection to start game ✅
- **After hand detected**: Play "lets_start_counting.mp3" ✅
- **After counting instruction**: Wait 2 seconds before starting number 1
- **Audio system**: MP3 files only, NO AI voice fallbacks ✅
- **STATUS**: ✅ FULLY WORKING

## 🚧 START GAME (PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED)
### Current Implementation:
- ✅ **Audio system**: All MP3 files load correctly from `/frontend/assets/audio/`
- ✅ **Number detection**: Fingers 1-5 detected via MediaPipe
- ✅ **Video display**: Clean video with hand landmarks only (no text overlays)
- ✅ **Game state management**: Backend tracks game phases and number progression
- ✅ **Audio callbacks**: Proper audio completion handling triggers next steps

### Game Flow (Numbers 1-5):
1. **Play number audio immediately** ✅ (from `\frontend\assets\audio\numbers\`)
2. **Show target number as image** ✅ (bottom-right corner overlay with PNG images)
3. **Wait 15 seconds** for correct gesture ⏳ (timeout system implemented)
4. **If timeout**: Replay number MP3 and continue waiting ⏳
5. **On correct gesture**: Play random positive feedback ✅ (`\frontend\assets\audio\positive_feedback\`)
6. **After feedback**: Wait 2 seconds → move to next number ✅
7. **Repeat until 5**: Game completes when user shows 5 fingers ✅

### STATUS: 🚧 CORE GAME LOGIC IMPLEMENTED, NEEDS INTEGRATION TESTING

## 🎯 CURRENT FEATURES WORKING:
- ✅ Camera selection and Full HD video streaming
- ✅ MediaPipe hand tracking with visual landmarks
- ✅ Complete audio system with MP3 playback
- ✅ Game phase management (setup → user setup → counting)
- ✅ Real-time gesture detection (1-5 fingers)
- ✅ Clean video stream (hand joints only, no text)
- ✅ Audio completion callbacks and timing
- ✅ Random positive feedback selection
- ✅ 2-second delays between audio for clarity

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- **Backend**: Python Flask-SocketIO with MediaPipe integration
- **Frontend**: HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript with WebSocket communication
- **Audio**: MP3 files with Web Audio API (no speech synthesis)
- **Video**: MJPEG streaming with hand landmark overlay
- **Resolution**: Full HD support with proper fallbacks
